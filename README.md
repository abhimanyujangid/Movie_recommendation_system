# Movie Recommender System

This Movie Recommender System utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies to users based on their past interactions and preferences.

## Overview

In content-based filtering, recommendations are made to users based on the attributes or features of movies that they have liked or interacted with in the past. This system analyzes the attributes of movies and recommends other movies with similar attributes.

## Features

- Personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
- No cold start problem, suitable for new users with limited interaction history.
- Transparency in recommendations, as they are based on movie attributes.

## Setup

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset of movies with their attributes. This can be done from various sources such as IMDb, Kaggle, etc.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to extract relevant features.
3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
4. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into a production environment.

## Usage

1. Provide input by indicating movies liked or interacted with in the past.
2. Receive recommendations based on the similarity of attributes to the input movies.
3. Explore and enjoy the recommended movies!
