## Movie Recommendation System Readme
## Overview
This Movie Recommendation System utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies to users based on their past interactions and preferences. Unlike collaborative filtering which relies on the preferences of other users, content-based filtering focuses on the attributes or features of the items themselves.

## How it Works
The system analyzes the attributes of movies that a user has liked or interacted with in the past. These attributes can include genre, actors, directors, release year, and more. Based on this information, the system recommends other movies with similar attributes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhimanyujangid/Movie_recommender_system.git
